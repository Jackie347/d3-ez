# d3-ez 
## D3 Easy Reusable Charts

**d3-ez** is a library of reusable charts which use [D3](http://www.d3js.org/). Inspired by Mike Bostock's tutorial [Towards Reusable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/), the aim of the library is to harness the power of D3, whilst simplifying the process of creating charts and graph making with D3. **d3-ez** makes it easier for people who are still learning JavaScript or D3 to quickly produce data visualizations with minimal code.

Compatible with D3 v4.

**d3-ez** also aims to make it easier to create interactive visualizations and dashboards with graphs which are clickable and linkable, see the Showcase above for examples.

What type of chart is best for different types of data?
* Bar Charts are good for quantitive data.
* Pie Charts for good to represent parts of a whole.
